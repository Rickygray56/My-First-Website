      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Richard Gray II</strong> and I'm a full stack javascript developer.
        I am 25 years old and I have a passion for all things technology. I wish to
        be able to establish a career in computer science to build upon my technical skillset.

      <h1>My Background</h1>
        <p>My background in technology stems back to high school where I took 2 courses in computer programming primarily
          learning the Java language. I then switched to gears to Audio Productions once I attended college to become an
          audio engineer. I enjoyed my time in school for music, but realized it was more of a hobby for me. Once I determined
          computer programming was a career I wanted to pursue, I enrolled into a coding bootcamp called CoderCamps.
          During my time I learned how to program using Javascript, MEAN stack including REACT and REDUX, and backend foundations 
          using MySQL, NoSQL, and Node.Js.

      <h1>Why I decided to learn programming</h1>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by the world of technology. More than anything, I love the art of creation. I enjoy
          the process of creating things and taking something from scratch and transforming it into a fully polished masterpiece.
          With this in mind, I started my search for a career that would allow me to create. I then came across computer programming
          which prompted me to try free coding websites like khan academy and codecademy and I was hooked ever since.
